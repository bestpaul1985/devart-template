## Description
Y.A.M.A is a game system which allowed a player to control a realy person as an avatar in real envirment to play a thrid person role player game. 

One of my dreams in my childhood was I wanted to become a GUNDAM (a human look robot by Janpaness carton) pilot. It became the insprition of Y.A.M.A. I dicided to turn a real human into a avatar. By using a camera carried on the back of the avatar, it captured a third person view. The third person view was streaming to an tablet holden by a player (polit). By touch buttons on the tablet, a specific audio command will send to the earphone worn on the avatar's ears. The commands told the avatar how to move such as turn left, turn right, trun back and fight. The avatar had to follow the command because a lot of hiden information in the AR codes could be only viewed by the polit. At the same time, the pliot needed to deal with a real human, a lot of accidents would happen.
